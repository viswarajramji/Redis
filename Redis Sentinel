Master and slave.

1. What is sentinal.
2. Quoram - minimum number of nodes need to runn the sentinal.
3. Down after milliseconds.

When master is down then sentinal is process to decide which slave can become a Master

Redis Application

Redis - Service  -> config.
Redis - Senitanal -> config.

Quoram :

is the condition that minimum number of nodes be avaialbe to run the sentinal Process if not met then the sentinal process doesnt not happens

Down After milliseconds :

The time duration provided before the sential process is started.


when the failed master is back then the master is made as slave


Sential Configuration:


Master Slave .

Master - Read And write

Slave -  Read

The records updated to Master gets replicated to the Slave at run time.


Steps for configuration of the Redis replica.

In Master

1. For Redis Master -> Redis Config , Set the port at which the master redis should run. "using :port //bind field
2. For Sentianal Master -> sentianal Config , Set the port at which the master sential should run. "using :port //bind field
3. For connecting Sential to master :use "Sentinel monitor name : <ip address of the  master redis server > <Quoram>"



In Slave

1. For Redis slave  -> Redis Config , Set the port at which the slave redis should run. "using :port //bind field
2. For Replication -> Redis Config , set the replication of to master redis
2. For Sentianal Master -> sentianal Config , Set the port at which the master sential should run. "using :port //bind field
3. For connecting Sential to master :use "Sentinel monitor name : <ip address of the  master redis server > <Quoram>"



For starting redis :
redis-server

For starting sentinal:
redis-sentinal.
