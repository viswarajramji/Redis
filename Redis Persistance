Redis persistance :

if the process is killed then the values present in the repo is lost.

To handle this case redis have bougth the concept of the RDB and AOF

AOF is more effective in case of consistency and accurracy and reduced data loss.


RDB - Redis Database Backup

This is used to create a dump / snap shot when the condition is met.

Example :


save <seconds> <no of changes>

save 100 10000


Configration for RDB.

1. Redis.Config.
2. dir => provide the directory of the storage.
3. dbfilename=> name of the dump or snapshot
4. save <seconds> <no of changes>
5. when the application starts the data is restored from the .dump file.


AOF- Append only file.

Ths is used to append each command that get executed in redids to the AOF file.

All the redis query that get executed in redis are persisted to aof.

when the application starts the .aof file is executed and the data is resotred to the Redis server.

If both RDB and AOF are on , then the restore of AOF happens due to less data loss.


Configration for AOF

1. Redis.Config.
2. dir => provide the directory of the storage.
3. appendonly => yes/no
4. appendfileName=<name of the AOF file>
6. appendfsync = always /everysec
7. when the application starts the data is restored from the .aof
