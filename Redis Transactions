Redis transaction provide ACID Property to the Application.

Example when 2 application are parallely updating the system then there is chance that the acid property is failed.
To handle this case , Redis has provided ways such as redis transactions.


The transaction options are as follows:

Multi

Exec

Discard

watch

unwatch


Syntax for using transaction are as follow:


Multi
    command1
    command2
    command3
Exec

Either everything is successful or not .

if incase we dont wanted the transaction to execute use discard.

use watch - when we wanted to monitor the value change of the field and ensure that the transacation fails if the value in the field changes.

use unwatch to unlink the watch.
